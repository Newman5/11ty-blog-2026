Getting the blog muscles going.  This is a post for today. I'm curious about writing inside of VSCode.  As I type this, I kinda wish I was in Obsidian.  However, this would work well for devlopement blogs that could be included with each repo / project.  and 11ty would be much better than all that overhead of other site frameworks IMHO.

And, today I got the newmanure.com pointer set.  Could this become my main blog?
