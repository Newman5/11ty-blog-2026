This is the baby steps post.  

## Baby Steps

Most babies walk by the time they are walking.

The code editor is an issue.  By default it is vim and it suggests changing the bashrc file... which I think is too much trouble.  I thought about a local config file or even a .env file to store a varialbe for EDITOR, but I think simply changing the scripts (so far the new-post and new-link-post.sh) to open in the perfered editor.

Also, the 'show all posts' isn't working and that might a thing for the agent to work on while I ~~make a sandwich~~ do some healthy stuff.
