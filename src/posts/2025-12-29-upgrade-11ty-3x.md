## Updates

I'm enjoying working with the CoPilot to create this.  We had a problem and realized that the version of 11ty was old version 2.x. So, we updated to version 3.x and used an establish blog template as a model.

To improve in the future I will recommend a established template to base the code in this case 11ty on. I think the next steps will be to use the blog for series of some sort,  perhaps an RPG or some solo journaling game. My intention is to use the blog for learning bash scripting and Eleventy and it seems to be working.

Also I want to shout out to the good folks at the 11T blog for their healthy and happy encouragement.
