Welcome to your new 11ty blog! This is a learning-focused blog starter that includes helpful bash scripts to make blogging easier and teach you bash scripting along the way.

## Features

This blog includes:

- **Simple Bash Scripts**: Create posts, manage drafts, check for broken links
- **Link Blog Support**: Special template for sharing interesting links with commentary
- **Blog Statistics**: Track your writing habits and output
- **Beginner-Friendly Code**: Every script is heavily commented for learning

## Quick Start

Try these commands to get started:

```bash
# Create your first post
./blog-cli.sh new "My First Post"

# Create a link post
./blog-cli.sh link https://example.com "Check this out!"

# See all available commands
./blog-cli.sh

# View your blog statistics
./blog-cli.sh stats
```

## Learning Bash Scripting

All the scripts in the `scripts/` directory are written with beginners in mind. They use simple, clear patterns and include extensive comments.

Start by reading these files in order:
1. `blog-cli.sh` - The main command router (simplest)
2. `scripts/new-post.sh` - Creates blog posts (shows core patterns)
3. `scripts/list-drafts.sh` - Lists drafts (shows loops and text processing)

Then explore the others as you get comfortable!

## Writing in Markdown

This blog uses Markdown for writing. Here are some examples:

**Bold text** with `**Bold text**`
*Italic text* with `*Italic text*`

### Headings

Use # for headings (more # = smaller heading)

### Links

[Link text](https://example.com)

### Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Code

Inline `code` with backticks, or code blocks with triple backticks:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

## Next Steps

1. Read the README.md for full documentation
2. Create your first post
3. Explore and modify the scripts
4. Make this blog your own!

Happy blogging and happy learning! 🚀
