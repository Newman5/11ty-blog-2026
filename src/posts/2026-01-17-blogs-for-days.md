(straight dump from my Obsidian vault today - it's snowing in NYC and time to check it out)
I want to learn A web building framework other than Astro and I want it to be closer to open web standards away from React and I want it to be as possible but with a good developer community and existing tools.

[[11ty-blog-2026]] -  I created the 11T blog 2026 and the bash blog suite of scripts.  newmanure.com points here

Mac and Cheese Blog (check my github for the links) was an experiment with 11 and copilot with the zero point template. it does have the Sveltia CMS running.  It did make a change - copilot did - to the img plugin to make the path pre fix better.  It's running and working but still needs to fix the prefixpath stuff which I worked out in the CocaCola blog experiment.  

Oreo was the experiment was 0 point without the copilot. No Sveltia yet (to find Sveltia look for Content / Admin / index and config.yml )

Coca Cola blog was an experiment with the 11D base blog version 9.
