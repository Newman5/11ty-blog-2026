## Personal updates

It super cold.  There is a sport-stravaganza going on - Winter Olympics in Italy.  Carolina vs Duke (with all time thriller ending) and the SuperBowl (Seahawks vs Pats).  I've got lots going on and still loving the 11ty - especially after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzf9A9tkkl4), which really does show the simplicity of the software [That being said there are a few founddational knowledges that must be mastered in order to feel comfortable.  Which is a much lighter weight task than learning React or Next or something.  I finally learned enough React by learning Astro, but this 11ty feels back to my roots with plain HTML.  It's fun]
