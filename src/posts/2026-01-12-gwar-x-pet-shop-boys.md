No idea how I stumbled on this, but I can't get it out of my head.  It's Fast - it's punk.  It's weird - it's GWAR.  It's catchy AF - it's Pet Shop Boys with alittle extra

and I got to thinking about Bob Weir, who recently died.  Actually, I was telling my girlfriend that  there was a headline that said Bob Weir's final concert and I was like I was telling her "Oh yeah these guys always do this. they retire and they'll have a last concert and then they're back" ...  and she kind of looks at me and is like "no, he died on Saturday". Oops my bad.

 So in honor of the Grateful Dead and Mr Weir, I chose my first Grateful Dead album - In The Dark - for the soundtrack of my walk this afternoon. I definitely wore out the CD player Track 6 was one of my favorites.
