Well, I'm learning about bash and git and branches and push and pull and ... I finally lost some work with git.  I guess its a right of passage.  It's cool, I'm gonna rewrite what I had in a different way.  So it's a force iteration

Still loving the Olympics and all it's weirdness.

And the recipe I'm loving is a Crab Mac and Cheese - it's so good reheated in the oven.  I pop it in with a meat thermometer and when I hear that alarm, it's time to eat

I'm lookin over at my posts and can imagine that it's going to grow and grow.  Is there a way to archive it?  I look at that month of posts as short term memory.  Is there a way to 'archive' or move to long term memory.  How exactly does an RSS feed work?  is every single post in the rss.xml file?

hmmmm.  seems like I should know.
