I’m not so sure about this command-line interface. Images are a real bear as it stands now. I just spent several hours trying to figure out how to bring images quickly into this Markdown space.

It seems so easy in a visual CMS: you just select the image and put it there, and all of the boring stuff can be automated—meaning it goes to the right folder, it’s optimized, etcetera.

I did learn some stuff. I ultimately got two tools, which required a bunch of other setup. The tools are:

A Markdown image paste extension for VS Code, which required xclip to be installed on my Linux system and also required some configuration.

And ImageMagick, a Linux app.

There are several other apps for different use cases, and it’s sort of opaque as to what exactly each one is doing. I sort of miss—and probably will go back to using—the website Squash, but as it is now, this is what it is.
