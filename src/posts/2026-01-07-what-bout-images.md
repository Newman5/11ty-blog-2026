OK

 a blog is set up and I can quickly write posts that are formatted with the correct front matter. Template files are in place and the structure works.

I can use markdown to format text but what about images. I'd rather not hard code the images in HTML. Does markdown do something with images? In VS code? Is there a snippet text expander that does this? And I'd rather not download or edit images with the desktop application save it to my windows folder drag it over to my Linux folder Delete the zone identifier text thing and then copy directory into the code. There's got to be a better way. do you know?

```text
![](../../../../../../src/images/posts/ibelieve.png)
```

I got some headway on this but gotta stop for now...

one last thing... Can I do it by hand?

AH!  minor success.
